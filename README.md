# Email-Server
This is the server portion of an email-like java program which allows LAN network users to communicate with each other. The server must always be running for the client programs to work. The server communicates with the clients via the LAN network and the ip address of the machine the server is being hosted on must be hard-coded into each client. The server receives all messages sent by clients before sending them to the intended recipient client. The server was designed to be able to receive and keep track of up to 200000 messages without significant delay or crashing.
